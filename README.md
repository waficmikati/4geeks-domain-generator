# Domain Generator
To run the script, use `npm run start`.

A `domains.json` file will be generated will all the possible domain combinations in the arrays.

If the domain name ends with letters that are available as a domain suffix, the suffix will be incorporated as such in the final result. The console will show some examples of this.

Example: `thegreatpengu.in`
